                            </div>

                        <h3>About This Pattern:</h3>
                        <p>I've been fascinated with Illusion Crochet patterns for a while now, and the TARDIS seemed like a perfect fit for this technique. When viewed head on, the design will appear to be plain blue and white stripes with a few black accent lines, but when viewed from just the right angle, the TARDIS will be revealed! I've been using mine as a potholder/trivet, but it could easily be modified for use as a wall-hanging, pillowfront, etc.</p>
                        <p>Gauge is not super important to this design and you can feel free to experiment with different yarn weights and hook sizes depending on how large you want your finished product to be. Just don't use a hook that is too much smaller than your yarn&mdash; this results in very tight stitches. In the case of illusion crochet, this can make the outline of the shape fairly apparent when viewed head on, spoiling the "surprise" of the design.</p>

                        <h3>Experience Level</h3>
                        <p>This pattern requires some basic knowledge of Tunisian Crochet&mdash; I will assume you know terms like Forward Pass and Return Pass, as well as how to do a Tunisian Simple Stitch, Tunisian Reverse Stitch, and Tunisian Edge Stitch (the basic method of beginning and ending each row in Tunisian Crochet). You will also need to be able to switch colors at the end of each row and midway through the row in some cases.</p>

                              <h4>Special Notes:</h4>
                              <ul>
                              <li>Remember that when you color switch mid-row, you will have to perform the switch in both your forward <em>and</em> your return pass.</li>
                              <li>If you've done some illusion crochet before, you might notice that unlike a lot of similar patterns, each even row is <em>not</em> the exact inverse of the previous odd row. This is intentional and allows more specificity in the shapes you can create.</li>
                              </ul>

                            </div>

                        </div>

                        <h3>Materials</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>6.0mm Tunisian Crochet hook</li>
                          <li>Blue worsted weight yarn</li>
                          <li>White worsted weight yarn</li>
                          <li>Black worsted weight yarn</li>
                          <li>5.5mm standard crochet hook (for edging)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Grid &amp; How To Use It</h3>
                        <p>If you're experienced with Tunisian Crochet, you might only need the grid to get started on this pattern right away. Each row represents one full forward and return pass in the color indicated by the chart. The pattern works bottom to top, so you will be starting in the bottom right square after your chain. As with most Tunisian Crochet, the right side of the work will be facing you the whole time. If you need a little more of a breakdown, written steps are below!</p>

                        <h3>Edging &amp; Finishing</h3>
                        <p>I prefer a simple black edging for this design, but you can sub in your own preferred methods. I start in the top left corner of the work with black yarn and a 5.5mm crochet hook and single crochet around the entire piece until I'm back at the start, then fasten off. If you want to add a loop at the end for hanging, just add a few chains at the end and slip stitch back into the same space before fastening off. After that, clean up and weave in any loose ends hanging from the back of the work from your color changes. I also recommend pinning the finished potholder down to a blocking board, spraying it with a little water, and leaving it alone for a day to give it a more perfect square shape.</p>
