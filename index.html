                    <h3>Welcome to my world of wool!</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a longtime crocheter who owes so much to the help of friendly crafters both in real life and online, especially those who shared tips, tricks, and designs for free. I needed a lot of time to build confidence in my skill set  and was often afraid to buy a pattern before getting a sense of whether it would be too hard for me. As I learned new terms and techniques from each project I completed, I became comfortable enough to buy and try more advanced patterns, and have even begun to create my own!
                    </p>
                    <p>In this space I'd like to build on the advice I received and pay it forward by offering simple web versions of my designs for free, as well as eventually some general advice and tutorials. I will also include links to paid PDF downloads with each step photo-illustrated, but if you don't mind keeping a tab open while you work and you pay close attention to instructions, you can make any of these without spending a dime (except on yarn, of course)!
