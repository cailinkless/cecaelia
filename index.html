                            <h2>Welcome to my world of wool!</h2>
                            <p>For the past six years, Iâ€™ve been using crochet to make clothing, toys, and home decor for myself, friends, and family. Like many crafters, I owe so much of my progress to the help of fellow creators both in real life and online, especially those who shared their tips, tricks, and designs for free. As I learned new terms and techniques from each completed project, I became comfortable enough to buy and try more advanced patterns, and have now begun to create my own.</p>
                            <p>This is my space to build on the advice I received and pay it forward by offering simple web versions of my designs for free, as well as eventually some general advice and tutorials. I will also include links to paid PDF downloads with each step photo-illustrated, but if you don't mind keeping a tab open while you work and you pay close attention to instructions, you can learn how to make any of these projects without spending a dime&mdash; except on your yarn, of course!</p>
